# Average Site Color

Have you ever been curious about the average color of a website? Defined here as the weighted average RGB value of any image found.

A Node.js server uses a Python subprocess to crawl and scan the given URL. The actions and animations on the front are vanilla JS.

This is deployed via Glitch @ https://average-site-color.glitch.me/
